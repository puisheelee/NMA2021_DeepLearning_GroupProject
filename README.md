# NMA2021_DeepLearning_GroupProject

Part of Neuromatch Academy 2021 Deep Learning summer school group project - A network of choice neurons. 

Containing only my part of the work.

Using Steinmetz et al 2019 dataset, we trained a recurrent neural network (RNN) to predict behavioural choice. For further project details, please refer to the presentation.
